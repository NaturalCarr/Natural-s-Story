My name is Natural B. James Tiberius Kirk Carr.
I love long walks on the beach. Well, not the beach, beach, but the sand-beach, and not dirty beach sand, but clean, beautiful soft pure sand, the sane they use in silicone, the silicone they use in computer chips. Yeah, that's is, I love long walks on computer ships. I7's and GTX 1080's under my feet, dog.
I like tea, if you don't that's okay, we all have different tastes, yours are just objectively worse.
